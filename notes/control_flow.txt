Step-by-Step Transfer of Information

Browser → Nginx:

A user connects to the server via a browser (e.g., http://localhost).
The request goes to the Nginx container, 
which acts as a reverse proxy and serves static content or 
routes dynamic requests to the WordPress container.

Nginx → WordPress:

If the request is for WordPress (dynamic content), 
Nginx forwards it to the WordPress container running PHP-FPM.
The WordPress PHP scripts process the request.

WordPress → MariaDB:

To generate dynamic content (e.g., blog posts, pages), 
WordPress connects to the MariaDB container.
It queries the database using the credentials defined in wp-config.php.

MariaDB → WordPress:

MariaDB sends the queried data back to WordPress.
WordPress uses this data to render the requested page.
WordPress → Nginx → Browser:

The generated HTML page is returned to Nginx, which sends it to the browser.

Data and Configuration Flow
Nginx:
Configuration file defines how requests are routed (e.g., PHP requests go to WordPress).

WordPress:
Uses PHP to connect to MariaDB and dynamically generate content.

MariaDB:
Stores WordPress data like posts, users, and settings.
